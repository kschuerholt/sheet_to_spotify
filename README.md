Simple web player that takes song lists from a sheet, plays them via Spotify and displays song info along with contributor details.

Contributor avatar images can be stored in the ``contributor_images``
directory. They are served from ``/contributor_images/<filename>`` and can be
referenced in the ``CONTRIBUTOR_IMAGES`` mapping when creating the app.
